            <p>Search Engine, a Python-based tool, employs a Trie data structure to process HTML files, create an occurrence map, and deliver ranked search results. The Trie structure efficiently stores and retrieves words, enhancing search speed. HTML files are processed using BeautifulSoup and NLTK for tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming, resulting in an occurrence map associating stemmed words with files and counts. The search functionality utilizes the Trie and occurrence map to rank and display results based on stemmed word occurrences. With a dependency on Python 3.x, NLTK, and BeautifulSoup, this project provides a powerful and memory-efficient solution for efficient string storage and searching in HTML documents.</p>
